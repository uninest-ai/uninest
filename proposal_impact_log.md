- ‚úÖ Step B Complete Summary

  Actions Taken:

  1. Created property_embeddings table (migration f5a8b9c3d2e1)
    - Stores 384-dimensional vector embeddings (JSONB format)
    - One embedding per property
  2. Generated embeddings for 86 active properties
    - Used all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model
    - Combined title + description into vectors
    - Coverage: 100% (86/86)
  3. Implemented cosine similarity function
    - embedding_service.py:197-214
    - Compares query vector with property vectors
  4. Implemented RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)
    - hybrid_search.py:21-59
    - Merges BM25 + Vector rankings
  5. Integrated auto-embedding generation
    - sync_scheduler.py now auto-generates embeddings when fetching new properties
    - Runs hourly (incremental) and daily (comprehensive)

  Impact: Your Search is NOW Enhanced! üöÄ

  Before Step B (BM25 Only):

  - ‚ùå Query: "quiet apartment near campus" ‚Üí Only matches exact keywords
  - ‚ùå Misses properties with synonyms ("peaceful", "university")

  After Step B (BM25 + Vector + RRF):

  - ‚úÖ Query: "quiet apartment near campus" ‚Üí Understands semantic meaning
  - ‚úÖ Finds properties with "peaceful", "calm", "university nearby"
  - ‚úÖ Combines keyword matching (BM25) + meaning matching (Vector)
  - ‚úÖ RRF fusion ranks best results from both methods

  New Capabilities:

  | Feature         | Description                                 | Benefit                             |
  |-----------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
  | Semantic Search | Understands meaning, not just keywords      | Better recall for long-tail queries |
  | Hybrid Ranking  | BM25 (precision) + Vector (recall)          | Best of both worlds                 |
  | Auto-Update     | Embeddings auto-generate for new properties | Zero manual work                    |
  | 100% Coverage   | All 86 properties have embeddings           | Complete search index               |

  Example Query Improvements:

  Query: "modern loft with natural light"

  BM25 Only:
    ‚Üí Matches: "modern", "loft", "light" (exact keywords)

  Hybrid (BM25 + Vector):
    ‚Üí Also finds: "contemporary studio with large windows"
                  "industrial space with skylights"
    ‚Üí Understands: modern ‚âà contemporary, natural light ‚âà large windows
