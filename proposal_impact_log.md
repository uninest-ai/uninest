- ✅ Step B Complete Summary

  Actions Taken:

  1. Created property_embeddings table (migration f5a8b9c3d2e1)
    - Stores 384-dimensional vector embeddings (JSONB format)
    - One embedding per property
  2. Generated embeddings for 86 active properties
    - Used all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model
    - Combined title + description into vectors
    - Coverage: 100% (86/86)
  3. Implemented cosine similarity function
    - embedding_service.py:197-214
    - Compares query vector with property vectors
  4. Implemented RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)
    - hybrid_search.py:21-59
    - Merges BM25 + Vector rankings
  5. Integrated auto-embedding generation
    - sync_scheduler.py now auto-generates embeddings when fetching new properties
    - Runs hourly (incremental) and daily (comprehensive)

  Impact: Your Search is NOW Enhanced! 🚀

  Before Step B (BM25 Only):

  - ❌ Query: "quiet apartment near campus" → Only matches exact keywords
  - ❌ Misses properties with synonyms ("peaceful", "university")

  After Step B (BM25 + Vector + RRF):

  - ✅ Query: "quiet apartment near campus" → Understands semantic meaning
  - ✅ Finds properties with "peaceful", "calm", "university nearby"
  - ✅ Combines keyword matching (BM25) + meaning matching (Vector)
  - ✅ RRF fusion ranks best results from both methods

  New Capabilities:

  | Feature         | Description                                 | Benefit                             |
  |-----------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
  | Semantic Search | Understands meaning, not just keywords      | Better recall for long-tail queries |
  | Hybrid Ranking  | BM25 (precision) + Vector (recall)          | Best of both worlds                 |
  | Auto-Update     | Embeddings auto-generate for new properties | Zero manual work                    |
  | 100% Coverage   | All 86 properties have embeddings           | Complete search index               |

  Example Query Improvements:

  Query: "modern loft with natural light"

  BM25 Only:
    → Matches: "modern", "loft", "light" (exact keywords)

  Hybrid (BM25 + Vector):
    → Also finds: "contemporary studio with large windows"
                  "industrial space with skylights"
    → Understands: modern ≈ contemporary, natural light ≈ large windows

Usage of metrics:
● Perfect! I've implemented the metrics monitoring system. Here's what was created:

  Files Created/Modified

  1. Created /backend/app/metrics.py

  - Middleware to track request latency and count
  - /metrics endpoint returning performance stats
  - Tracks last 1000 requests and 1-minute QPS window

  2. Modified /backend/app/main.py

  - Added from app.metrics import attach_metrics
  - Called attach_metrics(app) after app creation

  3. Created /backend/scripts/load_test_metrics.py

  - Python script to generate 500 test requests
  - Uses 10 concurrent workers
  - Automatically fetches and displays metrics

  How to Use

  Step 1: Restart Backend

  docker-compose restart backend

  Step 2: Test the Metrics Endpoint

  Open browser or use curl:
  curl http://localhost:8000/metrics | jq

  You'll see (before load test):
  {
    "latency_ms": {
      "p50": null,
      "p95": null,
      "p99": null
    },
    "qps_1m": 0.0
  }

  Step 3: Run Load Test

  Option A: Using the Python script
  cd backend
  python scripts/load_test_metrics.py

  Option B: Using curl in a loop
  for i in {1..500}; do curl -s http://localhost:8000/ > /dev/null; done
  curl http://localhost:8000/metrics | jq

  Option C: Using Apache Bench (if installed)
  ab -n 500 -c 10 http://localhost:8000/
  curl http://localhost:8000/metrics | jq

  Step 4: View Results

  After load testing, check metrics again:
  curl http://localhost:8000/metrics | jq

  Expected output:
  {
    "latency_ms": {
      "p50": 12.3,
      "p95": 45.6,
      "p99": 89.1
    },
    "qps_1m": 8.33
  }

  What the Metrics Mean

  - p50 (median): Half of requests complete faster than this
  - p95: 95% of requests complete faster than this
  - p99: 99% of requests complete faster than this
  - qps_1m: Average queries per second over last 60 seconds

  Screenshot for Proposal

  After running the load test, take a screenshot showing:
  1. The load test output
  2. The /metrics endpoint JSON response with actual values

  This proves your API can handle 200-500 requests and track performance! 🎉
